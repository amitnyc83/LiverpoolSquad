#create a loop with each to loop through each players info and creates a new_player with calling itself with .new
#creates name, nationality, number, position using the css selector
#reads the attrs with the attr_accessor
#push the elements into the players array
#exits the loop and returns the players array with all the elements/attrs
#and returns it to the squad method which then returns it to the CLI class method which called it
